# ML SmartApp Hackathon Repository

Welcome to our ML SmartApp Hackathon Repository! This repository contains two directories, one for an analytical dashboard and another for an engineering drawing extraction, YOLO-based system.

## Analytical Dashboard

The analytical dashboard directory contains a web application that displays data visualizations and insights generated from machine learning models. The dashboard is built using Python and popular data analysis libraries, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

To run the dashboard, follow the instructions in the dashboard directory's README file. You'll need to have Python and the required dependencies installed in your machine.

## Engineering Drawing Extraction YOLO-Based System

The engineering drawing extraction YOLO-based system directory contains a machine learning model that uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to extract engineering drawings from images. This system can be used in a variety of applications, such as automated design review or document management.

To run the engineering drawing extraction system, follow the instructions in the system directory's README file. You'll need to have Python and the required dependencies installed, as well as a dataset of engineering drawing images.

We hope you find our repository useful, and we welcome contributions and feedback from the community. 
Happy hacking!
